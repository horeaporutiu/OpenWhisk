# OpenWhisk

This is the code from my blog on creating a translation app using Watons Language Translation and OpenWhisk: 

http://localhost:1313/blog/openwhisk-web-actions-and-rest-api-calls/

To get started, make sure you have: 

1) A free IBM Cloud 'Bluemix' account: https://console.bluemix.net/registration

2) the OpenWhisk CLI downloaded (also free): https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/cli

Next, make sure to input your Watson Translate Service username and
password in the test.js file, on lines 4 and 5, and your OpenWhiskURL (make sure to put in your own namespace in the URL) on line 88 of index.html. Happy coding!

Here is a demo of the finished app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQulg1pJAyU
